      <h4 class="mb-4">Disability can be incredibly isolating, and accessing the support network needed to thrive within our
        communities can be daunting.</h4>
      <p>That’s why community access and participation play such an important role within the NDIS
        (National Disability Insurance Scheme) - providing individuals with disabilities the additional support they need to take part in everyday activities and engage with the broader community. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-9">
        <p>At its core, community access and participation involve expanding opportunities for people with disabilities to engage in their environment and enjoy meaningful experiences confidently. It entails creating social, physical, economic, and educational pathways that provide you and  others affected by disability enhanced access to reach your full potential.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Being able to access your community is vitally important for you to socialize, work, and participate in activities that you enjoy. Unfortunately, many disabled people find themselves isolated and cut off from their communities due to a lack of accessibility. The NDIS recognizes the importance of community access and provides support to disabled people so that they can lead rich, full lives within their communities.</p>
